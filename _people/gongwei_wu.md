desp: Gongwei received his B.S. and Ph.D. at Huazhong University of Science and Technology and University of Science and Technology of China in 2011 and 2017, respectively. Gongwei joined Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School as a postdoctoral fellow in November 2017 and he was co-mentored by Drs. Myles Brown and David Weinstock. His research has been focused on the molecular pathogenesis of cancer and the development of novel therapeutics. He has integrated interdisciplinary concepts and techniques from molecular genetics, epigenetics, cancer biology, and medical oncology to determine how genetic and epigenetic abnormalities contribute to alterations in signal transduction pathways and gene expression, and how these alterations ultimately lead to malignant transformation and contribute to paraneoplastic features of these diseases. He also developed several novel therapeutic strategies and advanced a couple of clinical trials. He was invited to present his important findings at the AACR Annual Meeting and ASH Annual Meeting.   Gongwei is a recipient of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) Career Development Program Fellow Award, LLS SCOR grant, AACR Lymphoma Research Fellowship (Declined), NCI’s COVID award, Daiichi Sankyo research grant, HHMI Scholarship, and the Special Prize of President Scholarship for Postgraduate Students of Chinese Academy of Sciences. In addition, he is an invited reviewer of multiple journals, such as Molecular Cancer, Advanced Materials, Journal Hematology & Oncology, Advanced Science, Leukemia and eLife.
